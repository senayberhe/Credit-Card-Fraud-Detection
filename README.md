# Credit Card Fraud Detection with Python & Machine Learning

**Free Machine Learning courses with 130+ real-time projects Start Now!!**

For any bank or financial organization, credit card fraud detection is of utmost importance. We have to spot potential fraud so that consumers cannot be billed for goods they haven't purchased. The aim is, therefore, to create a classifier that indicates whether a requested transaction is fraudulent.

## About Credit Card Fraud Detection

In this machine learning project, we solve the problem of detecting credit card fraud transactions using Python's NumPy, scikit-learn, and a few other Python libraries. We overcome the problem by creating a binary classifier and experimenting with various machine learning techniques to see which fits better.

## Credit Card Fraud Dataset

The dataset consists of 31 parameters. Due to confidentiality issues, 28 of the features are the result of PCA transformation. "Time" and "Amount" are the only aspects that were not modified with PCA.

There are a total of 284,807 transactions with only 492 of them being fraud. So, the label distribution suffers from imbalance issues.
